# The Glitch

Welcome to The Glitch, our small corner of the interwebs!

## Community

The Glitch is a small friendship-orientated Discord community founded in 2017 by Glitchy, now currently owned
by [KJP12](https://github.com/KJP12).

We strive to provide an emphasis on friendships and bonding in our small community, providing a welcoming place to talk
about automotive, technology, media & games; a little bit of everything.

We even have annual Minecraft survival servers, using Fabric as the base to allow the community to suggest various
additions to the base game.
